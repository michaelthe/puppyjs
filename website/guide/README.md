# Introduction

PuppyJS is a framework agnostic E2E (end-to-end) testing and mocking tool for front end developers.
Puppy depends on [Jest](http://jestjs.io/) for tests and [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) 
for the testing environment so if you know these tools then you already know 80% of Puppy.

Puppy also lets you mock HTTP APIs and web socket events so you can 
develop your application until the backend is ready as well as
run your E2E tests against the same mock API and socket events you used for development.
